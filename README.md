# Gradle Playground

[![Gradle Build](https://github.com/tinohertlein/udemy-modern-gradle-fundamentals/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tinohertlein/udemy-modern-gradle-fundamentals/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repository started as place for the code I was creating while following along
the [Udemy course: Modern Gradle Fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-gradle-fundamentals) by Jendrik
Johannes.

By now, it is my playground to try out all sorts of Gradle things before (maybe) applying them to 'real' projects.
